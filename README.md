# Statistics-220
This is my repo for STATS 220.   A little about me:  - I am undertaking a degree in Psychology and Anthropology- I am taking STATS 220 because it is actually fun on top of being useful for research purposes and as a interesting lens to view the world through- I am interested in learning the skills to conduct my own statistical inquires.
